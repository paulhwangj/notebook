# AWS Fargate

# What is AWS Fargate?
```
AWS Fargate is a container deployment and management technology. Customers are no longer required to
provision, configure, and scale virtual machine clusters to run containers.
```
Similar to how clusters can be ran on EC2 instances, clusters can also be ran on AWS Fargate. Fargate is a serverless environment for running containers where users **aren't required to manage the underlying infrastructure (the servers).** Consider it **on-demand clusters,** making it quick to launch and scale and **allows you to manage everything at the container level.**  

To summarize, **AWS Fargate removes the management of the underlying infrastructure (servers) and allows a company to focus on writing high-level applications rather than spending time on managing servers.**
