# Kubernetes

# What is Kubernetes?
**Kubernetes is the industry standard for container orchestration.** It helps manage containers and containerized applications.

**Kubernetes is also very nice due to its highly-declarative nature**; allowing for developers to describe how they want a system to behave with Kubernetes knowing how to create that for them.

# Why do we need Kubernetes?
With the rise of many containerized applications that contain hundreds or even thousands of containers, we need tools to help manage all those containers.

Orchestration tools (like Kubernetes) offers:
* **High availability** => meaning there's no downtime.
* **Scalability** => high performance and able to manage larger loads.
* **Disaster recovery** => backup and restore.
